He encouraged me to learn C, which soon led to me exploring C++, Python, and Java, though I didn’t deep dive into these languages during that time. We built our first calculator using C for our magazine purpose (if I remembered correctly), which was an amazing experience and sparked my interest in programming.\nHowever, during my first year of undergraduate studies, I encountered competitive programming (CP) and felt frustrated when I couldn’t excel in it. I then shifted my focus to academic studies but didn’t achieve a high GPA in my first year. In my second year, I decided to explore Data Science, leveraging my introductory statistics courses, and everything started to click. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic gave me ample time to invest in my interests, allowing me to learn JavaScript and delve into both frontend and backend development with technologies like Node.js, Express, and React.js, among others. During this time, I watched numerous tutorials and took courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera.\nI also managed to work for a small IT company. Besides, I created various projects, which I stored on GitHub, such as Monitoring COVID-19 cases\r, Dummy cart system\r, mimicking a microservice\rand many more. You can view some of my notes from this period in this repo\r.\nI later met Md. Abu Taher\rbhai and took his paid course on web scraping\r. In this time I also maintain a facebook group eulerian\rand undergraduatemath\rwhere I encourge other to learn tech related and math related things respectively. Around this time, I also connected with a senior named Awnon Bhowmik\rbhai and began exploring cryptography and cybersecurity. This exploration led to the publication of a paper\r, which deepened my interest in academia.\nIn my third year, I began focusing on research-based learning, exploring various areas. My final year project was on Deep Learning in Computational Fluid Dynamics\r, and my Master’s thesis focused on pure mathematics, specifically Calabi-Yau manifolds. As evident, my learning journey has been quite diverse, encompassing both computer science and pure mathematics. This diversity led me to pursue computational mathematics, with a particular focus on pure mathematics. You can see my complete academic progress in my CV\r.\n",

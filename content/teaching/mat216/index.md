## Course Outline

In this course, we will learn:

- Row operation and Why row operation didn't change the solution set?
- How to solve a system of linear equations by Gaussian Elimination method or Gauss-Jordan method?
- How to interpret general solution of a linear system? And how to get it through the nullifying column combination.
- What is vector space, subspace, linear combination, linear independence, span, basis, dimension and what not!
- What is linear transformation? How it help to understand vector spaces?
- Four fundamental subspaces
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector of a linear transformation.
- Diagonalization, Inner Product, Gram-Schmidt Process

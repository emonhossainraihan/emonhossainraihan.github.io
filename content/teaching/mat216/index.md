## Course Outline

In this course, we will learn:

<!-- <details> -->
<summary><b>Midterm</b></summary>

- Row operation and Why row operation didn't change the solution set?
- How to solve a system of linear equations by Gaussian Elimination method or Gauss-Jordan method?
- How to interpret general solution of a linear system? And how to get it through the nullifying column combination.
- What is vector space, subspace, linear combination, linear independence, span, basis, dimension and what not!
- What is linear transformation? How it help to understand vector spaces?
- Four fundamental subspaces

<!-- </details> -->

<!-- <details> -->
<summary><b>Final</b></summary>

- Eigenvalue and eigenvector of a linear transformation.
- Diagonalization, <del>Inner Product, Gram-Schmidt Process </del>
- Fourier Series (Periodic function, Fourier series, Half Range Fourier Sine and Cosine Series), Complex Notation for Fourier Series
- Fourier Transformations, Fourier Sine and Cosine Transformations.

<!-- </details> -->

## Extra content which I covered in this course:

- Application of Fourier Transfomation to denoising sound wave https://github.com/emonhossainraihan/MAT216_BracU/blob/main/demo.ipynb
- Why $\exp(M)$ give us the solution of a system of ODE:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dt}\\begin{bmatrix}x(t)\\\y(t)\\end{bmatrix}=\\exp\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}
          a& b\\\ c& d
      \\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\begin{pmatrix}x(0)\\\y(0)\\end{pmatrix}
  $$

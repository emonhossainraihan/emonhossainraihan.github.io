## Course Outline

In this course, we will learn:

<!-- <details> -->
<summary><b>Midterm</b></summary>

- The underlying vector space are isomorphic $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$, then how Complex plane is different than $R^2$?
- Understanding the Complex variable
- General Functions of a Complex variable
- Limit and Continuity in Complex variable
- Differentiability, harmonic and Analytic function
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- <details> -->
<summary><b>Final</b></summary>

- Line integral
- Integration in Complex variable
- Laplace Transformation

<!-- </details> -->

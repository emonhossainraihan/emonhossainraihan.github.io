I develop web applications, with my core skills rooted in JavaScript. I enjoy accomplishing most tasks using JavaScript. Currently, I am working on integrating deep learning with my research interests, specifically in geometry.

You can talk to me about:

- Front-end development using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, JavaScript, ReactJS, Ant design, Bootstrap
- Backend development using NodeJS, Express
- Database stuff using Prisma, SQlite, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Full stack stuff using NextJS
- Web automation using Puppeteer
- Deployment stuff using Docker, Kubernetes

You can still talk to me about things I am still learning:

- Languages like Python
- Data structures and algorithms
- Machine Learning, Neutral Network, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence

## Here are my several project which I built during COVID-19:

### passion4learning
